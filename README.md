Introducing a Netflix clone project, meticulously crafted with HTML,
TailwindCSS, React (v18), Firebase, Axios, and React Context. Through
this project, I delved deep into React, React DOM, and dynamic
routing, gaining valuable insights into building responsive and
interactive web applications. Working with real APIs provided me
with hands-on experience in fetching data, enhancing my
understanding of front-end data management. Additionally, the
integration of Firebase introduced me to concepts of authentication
in the frontend realm, further expanding my skill set.
